            <p>Jona loved music, and the songs you see here were two of his favorites. Their texts ministered greatly to him during his battle with cancer. We hope they will be a blessing to you as well.</p>

                    <h2>Be Still, My Soul</h2>
                    <p>
                        Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.<br>
                        Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.<br>
                        Leave to thy God to order and provide;<br>
                        In every change, He faithful will remain.<br>
                        Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend<br>
                        Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake<br>
                        To guide the future, as He has the past.<br>
                        Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;<br>
                        All now mysterious shall be bright at last.<br>
                        Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know<br>
                        His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on<br>
                        When we shall be forever with the Lord.<br>
                        When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,<br>
                        Sorrow forgot, love&apos;s purest joys restored.<br>
                        Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past<br>
                        All safe and bless√®d we shall meet at last.

                    <h2>Bow The Knee</h2>
                    <p>
                        What a privilege to come into God's presence,<br>
                        Just to linger with the One who set me free.<br>
                        As I lift my eyes and see His awesome glory,<br>
                        I remember Who He is and bow the knee.<br>
                        Bow the knee! Bow the knee!<br>
                        He is King of all the Ages! Bow the knee!<br>
                        God alone on His throne!<br>
                        See Him high and lifted up and bow the knee!<br>
                        Kneel before Him; all adore Him.<br>
                        As you live to love Him more, bow the knee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In His hand He holds the power of creation.<br>
                        With His voice He spoke, and all things came to be.<br>
                        Yet He hears each simple prayer I bring before Him<br>
                        When I humbly seek His face and bow the knee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bow the knee! Bow the knee!<br>
                        He is King of all the Ages! Bow the knee!<br>
                        God alone on His throne!<br>
                        See Him high and lifted up and bow the knee!<br>
                        Kneel before Him; all adore Him.<br>
                        As you live to love Him more, bow the knee.
