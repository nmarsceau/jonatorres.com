                <h2>Be Still, My Soul</h2>
                <p>
                    Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.<br>
                    Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.<br>
                    Leave to thy God to order and provide;<br>
                    In every change, He faithful will remain.<br>
                    Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend<br>
                    Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake<br>
                    To guide the future, as He has the past.<br>
                    Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;<br>
                    All now mysterious shall be bright at last.<br>
                    Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know<br>
                    His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on<br>
                    When we shall be forever with the Lord.<br>
                    When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,<br>
                    Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.<br>
                    Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past<br>
                    All safe and blessèd we shall meet at last.

                <h2>Bow The Knee</h2>
                <p>
                    What a privilege to come into God's presence,<br>
                    Just to linger with the One who set me free.<br>
                    As I lift my eyes and see His awesome glory,<br>
                    I remember Who He is and bow the knee.<br>
                    Bow the knee! Bow the knee!<br>
                    He is King of all the Ages! Bow the knee!<br>
                    God alone on His throne!<br>
                    See Him high and lifted up and bow the knee!<br>
                    Kneel before Him; all adore Him.<br>
                    As you live to love Him more, bow the knee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In His hand He holds the power of creation.<br>
                    With His voice He spoke, and all things came to be.<br>
                    Yet He hears each simple prayer I bring before Him<br>
                    When I humbly seek His face and bow the knee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bow the knee! Bow the knee!<br>
                    He is King of all the Ages! Bow the knee!<br>
                    God alone on His throne!<br>
                    See Him high and lifted up and bow the knee!<br>
                    Kneel before Him; all adore Him.<br>
                    As you live to love Him more, bow the knee.
